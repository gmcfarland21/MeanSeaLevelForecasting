# MeanSeaLevelForecasting
Rising ocean levels are a frequent topic in the news, but how quickly are they rising? Is this occurring at a predictable rate? This is what our team set out to analyze using data collected by NASA. We analyzed the data set spanning 27 years using three statistical methods: linear regression, time series analysis, and seasonal na√Øve forecasting. Specifically, we sought to answer the question, if we subset the dataset, can we create a model based on early data that successfully models later data values?
